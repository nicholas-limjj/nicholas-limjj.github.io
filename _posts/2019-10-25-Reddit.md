# Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to classify posts from 2 different subreddits, /r/depression and /r/anxiety.
The motivation behind this classification is for reddit users who may be suffering from either depression or anxiety issues but not properly diagnosed.
This will help them to post in the correct subreddit and be able to get more useful help from comments, since depression and anxiety displays similar symptoms but with varying solutions on tackling them.
